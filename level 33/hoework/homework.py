# 1 Task: Format a String
#Write a Python program that takes a user's name and age as input. Use the format() function to create a sentence that says, "Hello, [Name]! You are [Age] years old."

name = input("enter your name")
age = input("enter your age")

"Hello, + name + ! you are + age + years old"

# 2 Given a list of words ["Python", "is", "fun"], use the join() function to combine them into a single string, separated by spaces. The result should be "Python is fun".

list = ["Python", "is", "fun"]
print(" ".join)
